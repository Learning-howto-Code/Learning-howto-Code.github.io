<H2>Current Project</H2>
	<p> I am currently working on making a prototype gantry crane out of lego. I hope to then be able to control it via string and hopefully some motors and an Arduino. Eventually it would be very awesome to have a larger scale model that could be used in a scale train yard to move objects and even trains. I fantasize about eventually having it be able to pick up a object and then autonomously have it deliver to a certain spot. I feel this could be possible by taking the x,y,z coordinates and then having the motors change them to the desired place. I think I could also use an electro-magnet to pick up the objects so that I can easily connect and disconnects them from the crane.
